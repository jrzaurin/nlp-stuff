I get many compliments on this gorgeous bag.  I've spend 3 to 4 times the amount I paid for this and did not like them any better.  It may not last as long, but for the price and use I cannot complain.  Be careful; if you put all you can in here, you won't be able to carry it!!\n",

      " I've been eying these for awhile, And they are on the cheaper side but if you plan on buying jewerly that is this cheap you should expect that, Honestly the problems are only really in the chain used on the neckace, It's cheap and could break easily, But if you go to walmart and do some research it's incredibly easy to buy new necklace chain and clasps and just replace it with a higher quality chain.The bracelete is nice and it can be clasped to fit any sized wrist, The ring however is ajustable but on the smaller and cheaper side, I'd be careful where I wear this is all.They are pretty though and I feel like it was worth the money.\n",

      " These are really nice glasses and I can't live without.  I'm a repeat buyer for years (when I lose them)....but lens will come apart/break by top screw eventually. I've owned 4 pairs of these and the lens always breaks there after about 8-12 months. They replaced them all but it's is not free to do this even under warranty. Charge a service fee and you have to ship back. I've owned Ray Bans that this never happen to. Just a pain to keep returning for repair. You have to be VERY careful when you clean them They are very fragile where the lens and screw are drilled in. They are light weight and that probably contributes to the breaking issue. Clean them very very gentle or in time they will break! Yours might be broken already and its just hasn't slipped out yet. The screw will still hold the lenses in.\n",

      " I was looking for an option that would keep the sun out, but stay on my baby's head.  This does it all.  It has a wide brim, so additional shading such as sunglasses are not necessary.  It has a 'cinch&#34; to tighten or loosen it, which is a great option and will grow with the baby.  I ordered the infant size and it fits my two month old great, give or take a few months.  Not sure it will still fit at 6 months.....but I think the price is good enough, that I will order the next size up by then.  If there is any negative about the hat, it would be that brim is a tiny bit too floppy, so I have to readjust it to keep baby's eyes visible.  But, that being said, I don't think it would be comfortable for the baby if it weren't as soft and comfy as it is.\n",

      " Love these.  I was preparing to travel by air and wanted something compact for my luggage.  I wear an size 8 shoe and the large is perfect.  Haven't had them long enough to wash yet, but they are quite sturdy.  They have a stiff, synthetic sole, but the inside footbed is soft and so is the rest of the slipper.  Embroidery is cute and I feel look feminine.  They are very comfortable.  I plan to save them for travel.\n",
